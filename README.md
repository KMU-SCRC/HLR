We are researching Underwater Wireless Communication for Advanced Diver Network (ADN).

This program supports a roaming service in an underwater network and manages a diver's movement, running on a surface gateway.

It updates Home Location Register (HLR) of the gateway with other gateways' signal.

It can be applied to provide a lot of services connected to a terrestrial communication network.
